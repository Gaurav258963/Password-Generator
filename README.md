# Password-Generator
A password generator is a tool designed to create strong, random, and complex passwords for securing accounts and data. These tools often allow users to specify criteria such as length, inclusion of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. The generated passwords are typically difficult to guess or crack, enhancing security against unauthorized access. Password generators can be standalone applications, browser extensions, or features within password management software, and are essential for maintaining good cybersecurity practices.
